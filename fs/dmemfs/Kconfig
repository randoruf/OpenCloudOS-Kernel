	help
	  dmemfs (Direct Memory filesystem) is device memory or reserved
	  memory based filesystem. This kind of memory is special as it
	  is not managed by kernel and it is without 'struct page'.

	  The original purpose of dmemfs is saving extra memory of
	  'struct page' that reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO)
	  for cloud providers.

	  To compile this file system support as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called dmemfs.
